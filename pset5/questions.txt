0. BMP:  Variable, depends on the number of bits specified in the header. 24 bits
   is common.
   JPEG: Supports 24-bit colour.
   PNG: 16.7 million.
   GIF: 256 max. 
1.  GIF
2.  Lossless writes the data in a more efficient way, while lossy is optimised for
    file size.  
3.  JPEG.
4.  The File stays on the drive but the computer forget his location and make its space to be reused by other files or programs.
5.  if all the zeros and ones used by those files have been reused by others.
6.  A collection of typedefs for making integer variables of custom sizes.
7.  You can fill up exactly the amount of space you want in a file which is good
    for things like bitmap headers.
8.  BYTE = 8 bits = 1 byte.
    DWORD = 32 bits = 4 bytes.
    LONG = signed 32 bits = 4 bytes.
    WORD = 16 bits = 2 bytes.
9.  Hex: 0x424d
    ASCII: BM 
10. bfSize is the total number of bytes in the file.
    biSize is the number of bytes in the info header.
11. biHeight is negative means that the bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner.
12. biBitCount.
13. If it can't find the file
14. Because we're always reading a struct so we only need 1 struct.
15. The padding would be 3, because 3 pixels * 3 bytes per pixel * 3 padding = 12, which is a multiple of 4.
16. It moves to a specific location in a file.
17. An integer constant which specifies that the offset provided is relative to the current file position.
18. An algorithm that removes the noise from a picture to reveal the hidden one.
